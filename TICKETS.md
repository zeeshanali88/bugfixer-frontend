## Customer Orders Table
### QA Notes
When viewing the Customer Orders table, the times don't always display correctly. They're in 24-hour format when they should be in 12-hour format with AM/PM displayed.

Additionally, time should display in (H)H:MM format, but currently 12:07 displays as 12:7.

There seems to be an issue with total price sometimes. On some order details, the total price is displaying values after the penny.
